# Alzheimer-Diagnosis-MRI-Scans-Python-MachineLearning

## üß† **Project Overview**
This project utilizes **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning** techniques to detect **Alzheimer's Disease** using **MRI Scans**. By combining features from **OpenCV** and a pre-trained **VGG16 CNN model**, the system classifies MRI scans as either **Healthy** or **Alzheimer's**. An ensemble learning approach integrates **Random Forest** and **XGBoost** classifiers to enhance prediction accuracy.

The system also provides results in a **visual and intuitive format**, helping to diagnose conditions effectively.

## üîç **Features**

### **Preprocessing**
- **OpenCV-based Feature Extraction**:
  - **Local Binary Patterns (LBP)**: Captures texture information.
  - **Canny Edge Detection**: Identifies edges in MRI scans.
- **CNN Feature Extraction**:
  - Leverages the **VGG16 model** pre-trained on ImageNet.
- **Image Resizing and Normalization**:
  - Ensures compatibility with the CNN model.

### **Classification**
- Combines features from OpenCV and CNN for robust predictions.
- Implements **Random Forest** and **XGBoost** for classification.
- Employs an **Ensemble Model** with **majority voting** for final predictions.

### **Testing**
- Predicts the condition of **individual MRI images**.
- Handles **batch predictions** for unseen datasets.
- Displays results in a **2x2 grid visualization** with annotated images.

### **Visualization**
- Annotates each image with **predicted results** and file names.
- Provides a **confusion matrix** to summarize classification performance.
